## Assignment 2
## Caching the inverse of a a matrix

## Function: creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## Function: computes the inverse of the special "matrix" object 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated,
## then cacheSolve should retrive the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
